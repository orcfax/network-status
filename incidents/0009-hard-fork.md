## Summary

Cardano experienced a fork in November 2025. On December 03, 2025 a series of
price deviations triggered an internal review which identified anomalous system
behavior potentially linked to the mainnet fork.

## Assessment

Internal review found three nodes with Kupo databases which did not restart on
Cardano mainnet recovery from the fork; these three nodes have been taken
offline and are having their databases reindexed.

All other nodes continue to operate as expected.
